My personal accounting program is a program for managing personal transactions of people. In this program, it is possible to register transactions, card information and information of people with whom you have transactions. It is also possible to save the image of the receipt for transactions. To view the completed transactions, there are many options to sort the transactions so that you can find the desired transaction easily.

Another part of the program is dedicated to transaction statistics, where you can view general statistics on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis, and you can also view transaction statistics specific to each person or card or any desired date.
